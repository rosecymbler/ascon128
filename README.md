# ascon128
Simplified version of the Ascon-128 encryption algorithm coded in SystemVerilog

This project implements the ASCON128 encryption algorithm using SystemVerilog. It covers initialization, data processing, and encryption phases, using modular components like permutation layers and finite state machines, with validation through ModelSim simulations.
